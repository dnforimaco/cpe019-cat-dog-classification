# Final Project CPE019 - Cat-Dog Classification

# 🐱🐶 Cat and Dog Classification Web App

This is a group project that showcases a machine learning model deployed as a web app using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). The model is trained to classify images as either **cat** or **dog** using a deep learning model saved in `.h5` format.

## 📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates the application of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to solve a binary image classification problem: distinguishing between cats and dogs. The web app allows users to upload an image, and it will return a prediction of whether the image contains a cat or a dog.

## ✅ Problems Solved with This Dataset

- **Image Classification Challenge**: Many deep learning and machine learning problems require models to interpret unstructured data like images. This dataset helps tackle the challenge of binary classification using raw image data.
- **Computer Vision in Practice**: It provides a practical implementation of convolutional neural networks for beginners and intermediate learners in deep learning.
- **Overfitting and Generalization**: Through data augmentation and model tuning, this project addresses common issues in machine learning such as overfitting.
- **Deployment of Deep Learning Models**: Deploying the model with Streamlit demonstrates how DL models can be turned into real-world applications with simple web interfaces.

## 📁 Dataset

We used a publicly available dataset of cat and dog images for training and testing the model. You can find the dataset at the link below:
